Using the 'cse344-test-file' file, write a Pig script that groups tuples by the subject column, and creates/stores histogram data showing the distribution of counts per subject, then generate a scatter-plot of this histogram. The histogram consists of:
* The x-axis is the counts associated with the subjects, and
* The y-axis is the total number of subjects associated with each particular count.
So, for each point (x,y) that we generate, we mean to say that y subjects each had x tuples associated with them after we group by subject.
